## Why having a lab?
This [Home Lab](/homelab) have been crucial to learn about [Networking](/post/networking/), [Virtualization](/post/virtualization), and [Amateur Radio](/post/radio). This lab allows me to have multiple repetitions behind the keyboard to get familiar with not only fundamentals, but also learning how to build networks. Even though this is a simple lab environment, I am able to design, develop, update and destroy virtual and network environments to support my learning. This lab is a non-production lab, but it does have access to the internet. Cisco Packet Tracker, GNS3 and my physical network have been paramount in my preparation for the [Cisco CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html) [certification](/post/certifications)

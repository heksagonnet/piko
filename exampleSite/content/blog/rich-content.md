## KD2YAE Amateur Radio

Although I have operated radios in the Army for over 20 years working with Tacsat, VHF, and HF, I have fallen in love with the excitement of the Ham Radio community. Surrounded by passionate enthusiasts who love to share their expertise. There is no telling who will be on the other side of the radio.

I was born in Puerto Rico but I am currently an active duty service member from the Army Signal Corps and home is where I am stationed. That makes Fort Drum, NY my home for the time being.

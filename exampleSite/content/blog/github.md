A while back, I was wondering what was [GitHub](https://github.com/jeanburgos) and how it was used. Although I had downloaded some resources from it, I never really understood what it was used for.

Turns out that I learned a ton more of many other things. I had zero clue what they were.
## The start of my learning journey
I was finally interested enough to begin my learning journey with Github. 

After watching many Youtube videos on what Github was, I realized that I needed a project to use Github to get me started. 

I decided to build a simple website (this website is right here), but I didn't know where to start. 

The last time I built a website was in 2005. I used Adobe Dreamweaver to create a canvas and publish it through an FTP connection. I am no expert, but that is not the best method to build a website. 

I had zero knowledge of markdown, and my HTML skills couldn't go beyond a "Hello World" page.
## What I learned?
  - What is GitHub, and how to use it.
  - What is Hugo and how to use it
  - What is Visual Studio Code and how to use it
  - What is Netlify and how to use it
  - What is Google Analytics and how to use it
## Tools used
#### Hugo
I turned to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as it promised to be the simplest way to build a website. Hugo uses templates like the one I am using on this website [(Piko) created by heksagon](https://www.heksagon.net/template/piko/). After many failed attempts using other templates (I'm sure I was doing it wrong) decided to stick with Piko. It was a bit difficult to understand at first, but there is no doubt this is one of the best Hugo templates out there. 

I am still wrestling with some issues. Sometimes I spend way too long trying to get something to work. After hours of watching Youtube videos or reading online, I have to move on to use a different strategy. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of documentation I could use to overcome these issues.

#### Netlify
To publish my website, I went with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) because of a good suggestion from a Youtube video. The first template I used had massive issues. I learned that adding the public directory and declaring the version of Hugo I used to fix those critical errors. After long hours, the website did not look the same as it did on my localhost. I am not sure why that was, but after three days, I gave up using the clarity theme. 

Initially, I didnâ€™t know how to get the social media buttons or the contact form to work, but I could figure it out by accident. I want to add a lot more content to the website, but I will build it little by little. I am delighted with the progress I made.
 
#### Goggle Analytics
[Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/) is a tool to track the number of visitors to your website. The Piko template made it very easy to set up. Simply set up a free account with Google Analytics and add your code, name, and number to a set area in the main file. It works as expected.  
## Steps

#### Github Setup

After all of these issues were straightened out, I was able to practice how to use GitHub. 
- I created a GitHub account [jeanburgos](https://github.com/jeanburgos) where I could find and fork the Piko theme. I understand that forking creates a copy of the original content and places it on your account. This makes sense because I want to change my website, not the original template.

[GitHub](https://github.com/jeanburgos) is more than just a repository (a place to store files online); it is great for version control. See, building a website is not a one-time deal kind of thing. It will have multiple iterations of the site. Change a word here and there, add a picture, and make all the little tweaks you want to get your site just right. I build this alone but imagine multiple people working towards the same goal. GitHub helps keep control of every version.
#### Developing Environment
- I got mixed up between [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I still couldn't tell you what the different application for both is, but I just knew that it looked different from many of the videos I watched trying to get Github and the developing environment. I used Visual Studio Code to link a master branch and link the repositories. Once this was completed, I was able to create *push* and *pull* requests between Github and my computer running Visual Studio Code. Another area that took me some time to understand was that it is necessary to not only save but *commit* what you saved so that it can be sent to GitHub. 

- After GitHub was set up, I was able to link it with Netlify. The chain reaction looked like this.
1. Changes made to my computer 
2. Save changes > commit saved changes (must type commit message)
3. Commit is saved and updated in Github
4. Github content is sent and synced with Netlify to publish on the website automatically.


### Thoughts
Building all of this has taken a few weeks to design and develop. It has been a tremendous yet unexpected learning opportunity. I feel a lot more comfortable with the process and appreciate each tool's value. There is excellent help online. Each tool has a great and helpful community that consistently adds valuable content to assist everyone on their learning journey.

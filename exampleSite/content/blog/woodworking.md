# Woodworking Projects
My father was a woodworker for many years. He is an incredible artist when it comes to creating furniture and many wood projects. He has made a living with his talents. I learn by watching him but I am a fraction of the artist that my father is. Nevertheless, I enjoy woodworking. It really engages my mind into a forward thinking problem solving state. It's a great feeling and I get a lot of satisfaction by the results.

I have a small workshop in my garage where I tear up wood and play with sawdust. :grinning: I have made a lot more woodworking projects but I always forget to take a photo during and after the project. I have slowed down making any more woodworking projects because of the price of lumber :dollar: and because my garage is really cold in the winter.

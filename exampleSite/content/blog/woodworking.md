# Woodworking Projects
My father was a woodworker for many years. He is an incredible artist when it comes to creating furniture and many wood projects. He has made a living with his talents. I learn by watching him but I am a fraction of the artist that my father is. Nevertheless, I enjoy woodworking. It really engages my mind into a forward thinking problem solving state. It's a great feeling and I get a lot of satisfaction by the results.

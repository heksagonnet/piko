#### Preparation
My preparation for the PMP was extensive. I used the following sources:
  - [PMProLean 5 day boot camp](https://www.pm-prolearn.com/certification-courses)
  - [Andrew Ramayal PMP prep course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/pmp-certification-exam-prep-course-pmbok-6th-edition/ "PMP Certification Exam Prep Course 35 PDU Contact Hours")
  - [PMI Study Hall Plus Exam prep](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/certification-resources/pmi-study-hall?s_kwcid=AL!8620!3!585896072856!e!!g!!pmi%20study%20hall&utm_job_number=170&utm_region_name=north_america&utm_funnel_stage=customer_acquisition&utm_marketing_channel=paid_media&utm_marketing_subchannel=search_ppc_nonbranded&utm_start_date=03072022&utm_end_date=03312030&utm_source=google&utm_custom_field_one=study_hall_north_america&utm_custom_field_two=study_hall_brand&utm_custom_field_three=585896072856&utm_custom_field_four=pmi%20study%20hall&utm_custom_field_five=e&gclid=CjwKCAiAwomeBhBWEiwAM43YIHtq3XIk8eK8DuNQME_UCDkW2kLitlxlcH_ZcZ3o4RXMM-bWYL-qPBoC97AQAvD_BwE)

#### What did I learn during this journey 
I learned that there are a lot of parallels between missions that I have completed in the military and what Project Managers in the industry do. During this preparation I was able to learn about the business aspect of project management including Earn Value Management formulas and PMI framework for projects. I learn to translate my military experience in relevant terms that can be understood beyond the military. 
#### Exam
The PMP exam is without a doubt one of the hardest tests I have ever taken. This test is four hours 180 questions on a wide range of subjects from People, Process, and Business Development. The current version of the exam has a great number of questions covering waterfall, agile and hybrid project approaches. The exam is so long that you are allowed to take two 10 minute breaks. There are [many requirements](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/pmp-project-management-professional/how-to-apply-for-the-pmp) such as minimun of 36 months of project experience if you have at least a bachelor or 60 months of experience before you can take the test without a degree. 
#### Applicability
Everything that I have learned in this journey is critial in my career as I plan to pursue an IT Project Management career beyond the military.

#### Preparation
My first attempt at the CompTia Security+ was a failure by only a few points. I did not prepare well as I though that the my experience in the IT field was sufficient to pass. That was a humbling experience. For my second attempt I dedicated a great deal of time to prepare. 
- I use Jason Dion's CompTIA Security+(SY0-501) course and the associated practice exams to prepare. 
- Professor Messers Security+ Practice Exam
- And the most helpful resouce of all, Darril Gibson's CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-501 Study Guide.
#### What did I learn during this journey 
This test has a very wide range of subjects. I particularly enjoyed learning about encryption and it's place within the CIA triad. (Confidenciality, Integrity, and Availability)
#### Exam
The exam covered the following areas
1. Threats, Attacks and Vulnerabilities (21%)
2. Technologies and Tools (22%)
3. Architecture and Design (15%)
4. Identity and Access Management (16%)
5. Risk Management (14%)
6. Cryptography and PKI (12%)

They were not easy, but with enough preparation I was able to score fairly decent. 
#### Applicability
The knowledge in this exam is very relevant to everything else that surrounds IT, cloud or any other tech related subject. Very useful. 

![](/blog/certifications/networkplus.png) [Network Plus](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/network)
#### Preparation
I used Jason Dion's CompTIA Network+ (N10-008) Full Course & Practice Exam to prepare for this exam. 
#### What did I learn during this journey 
I feel that some of the material covered in this exam was included in Security+. Although I did learn about some new concepts, this exam does not really prepare anyone to be a network engineer like Cisco's CCNA would. 
#### Exam
I hate taking tests regardless of how well prepared I think I am. But this test was ok for an entry level certification.
#### Applicability
As mentioned before, the content of this certification is not ideal for a network engineer.

![](/blog/certifications/itil.png) [ITIL V4](https://www.axelos.com/certifications/itil-service-management/)
#### Preparation
I used the [ITPRO ITIL Course](https://www.itpro.tv/courses/itil/) to prepare for this exam. 
#### What did I learn during this journey 
A lot of the material cover in this certification are things that we do at work everyday. But the course was good to identify some areas of improvement. 
#### Exam
The [ITIL](https://www.axelos.com/certifications/itil-service-management/) exam is not too hard if you prepare. However, when it comes to the exam experience, this has to be my worse experince when taking a test. Axelos uses their own testing application unlike CompTIA and many other who use [Pearson Vue](https://home.pearsonvue.com/Test-takers.aspx). My application crashed over 30 times before getting access to the test. I tried three different computers and two different technicians. The first technician quit. 
#### Applicability
The content of this certification is very relevant to great a solid IT Service Management plan that is about customer focus and process improvement.

#### Preparation
- [AWS Cloud Practitioner Training](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learn-about/cloud-practitioner/) 
- [AWS Cloud Quest Game](https://aws.amazon.com/training/digital/aws-industry-quest/)
#### What did I learn during this journey 
I got a chance to explore the AWS cloud architecture. This was a very enlightened experience. The course was very good, and free. But the Cloud Quest Game was my favorite time while preparing for a certification. Graphics were not the best, but the applicability of the actions in the game served to solidify my understanding of the AWS Cloud Architechture and how to use it.

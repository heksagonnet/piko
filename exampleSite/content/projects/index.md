***I became certified as a Project Management Professional in 2022. This was a tremendous accomplishment to finish my military career. After running projects for many years I wish I had become certified sooner.***

## Is it really Project Management?
During my transition from the military I encounter a lot of opinions questioning whether or not service members are Project Managers or now. Although every organization's idea of a project manager differs I like to think that service members in fact serve in a capacity similiar to project managers in the industry. 

The [Project Management Institute](https://www.pmi.org/) defines a project as “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique project service or result.” Projects are temporary and close down on the completion of the work they were chartered to deliver.

As oppose to projects, operations are the ongoing execution of activities and they follow an organization’s procedures to produce the same result or a repetitive service. Operations are permanent in nature.

Projects have five phases that are initiaitng, planning, executing, monitoring and controling and closing. There are [10 knowledge areas and 49 process groups](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/pmbok-guide-pm-knowledge-areas-6703) associated with each of these phases and they each feed into each other to server as a guiding framework. 
### Command Post Field Communications Infrastructure Project
##### Initiating Phase
**1. Understand why the project was initiated**
- The Command Post field communications infrastructure is critical for commanders to communicate with higher, lower and peer executives as well as internal and external rotary aviation staff in any environment. This infrastructure must be mobile, yet versitile to accomodate a variety of services and systems . 

**2. Define the key objectives of the project**
- Install and delive a network achitechture to provide secure voice, data and video capabilites. 

##### Planning Phase
**3. Outline the project statement of work**
- Collect customer voice, data and video requirements to communicate with higher, lower and peer organizations for multiple functional areas and the required dates.
- Design, test, implement and support an architechture to meet customer requirements use existing capabilites  
- Ensure that all IT functional teams are trainned and capable to install and operate the necessary equipment
- Generate installation design using customer's feedback from multiple functional areas to provide installation guidace based on available capabilites 
- Estimate and procure consumables for the proper installation of copper infrastructure 
- Participate in planning meeting to coornitate with multiple sections to establish their intent and execution plan for deploying their systems for the organization and determine project acceptance criteria
- Conduct site survey with customer to ensure that satellite and communication assets have clearance to operate
- Request satellite and radio frequencies for testing and for the duration of the project
- Create and provide a Work Breakdown Schedule for the Network Operations, System Administration, Radio, COMSEC and Helpdesk sections
- Create a transportation plan for all equipment and personnel required for project
- Conduct a risk assessment, and communiate mitigation plan to all functional teams
- Meet with internal teams to discuss the WBS and execution details
##### Execution, Monitoring and Controlling Phase
- Monitor project execution and ensure every team has the necessary tools, personnel, and guidace ensuring that tasks are being completed within scope and in accordance to the WBS. Remain available and able to address any project issue to avoid delays. 
- Conduct design and infrastructure testing of copper, fiber, radio and satellite of WAN and LAN to ensure capabilites are being delived as planned
- Update stakeholders in the project progress and solicit feedback to ensure that the project will meet expectations
- Establish a help desk before customer's arrival to ensure that every customer has the necessary support to have access to knowledge management and special systems
##### "Soft Closing" (Not a real term, but more of an additional requirement based on military structure)
- Obtain projet acceptance from stakeholders before moving into the next phase
- Transfer project to operations to maintain 24 hours support and on call technicians for critical systems
- Conduct walkthroughts daily to ensure customers have access to the required capabilities
- Participate in meetings to discuss project and system status while addressing any necessary issues with executive teams
- Communicate with Network Operations, System Administration, Radio, COMSEC and Helpdesk sections on plan to establish and communicate a plan to recover the deployed infrastructure
- Execute site break down plan safely ensuring that nobody is hurt or equipment damaged.  
##### Closing Phase
- Collect feedback and lessons learned from stakeholders and the Network Operations, System Administration, Radio, COMSEC and Helpdesk sections to use gathered knowledge in future projects

**4. Identify major deliverables** 

Install and test copper infrastructure according to network design
Establish satellite transport
Establish radio transport
Establish communications node with voice and date LAN and WAN
Ensure customer devices have network connectivity and access to digital resources
Enterprise help desk and network operations take over

**5. Select key milestones**

Physical network infrastructure installed and tested
Network transport established
Stakeholders have access to digital resources
Establish enterprise help desk operations
Breakdown and recover equipmet at the site
Collect feed back

**6. Identify major constraints**

Limited transportation
Limited personnal to establish systems providing 24 hours support
Daily fuel operations to maintain power in austere remote locations
A/C, generator and vehicle maintenace must be conducted
Limited spare parts
Limited bandwidth requires traffic shapping based on customer's needs
Budget is limited and must operate with equipment on hand

**7. List scope exclusions**

Additional budget is not approved
Additional time- projects must be ready by the required time, and must remain up during the set duration. 

**8. Obtain sign-off**

Sign off is done by the commanding officer or appointed executive officer

Through the life of these projects there is no doubt that we visit the **10 knowledge areas** of project management.

|Project Integration Management|Project Scope Management|Project Schedule Management |
|Project Cost Management|Project Quality Management|Project Resource Management|
|Project Communications Management|Project Risk Management|Project Procurement Management|
|Project Stakeholder Management|

These type of projects require coordinations with multiple functional areas within the organization as well as externally to subordinate, and higher (vertical) and peer (horizontal) organizations. Command Post Field Communications Infrastructure Projects are executed four to five times a year to support organizatinals tactical and strategic goals. These projects can be done locally, or deployed to remote locations statewide or overseas in a similar approach.
